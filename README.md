# UCDPA_KayleighSwords
This project was submitted for assessment to UCD Professional Academy.
It contains three folders.
The first is charts which contains .pngs of the graphs created
The second is data which contains my data source in a .csv file
The third is sub programs - there were a number of prices to the project and i chose to work on some of them in separate files so as not to accidently overwrite 
or break anything in the code which was already working. These files are saved in here.
The last thing in the main folder is the finished project - Main_Project.py. This contains all the code working together for the project.
